# CaptchaHub Monorepo

**CaptchaHub is a monorepo that provides a unified collection of integrations with various captcha providers.** This repository serves as a central hub for managing and implementing captcha solutions across different web applications, ensuring a consistent and streamlined approach to captcha integration. It is designed to work seamlessly in nodeless (serverless) environments, making it ideal for modern web applications.

## Supported Captcha Providers

The CaptchaHub repository supports several captcha providers, including:

- **Turnstile**: A captcha solution that focuses on user experience and security.
- **HCaptcha**: A privacy-focused captcha service.
- **ReCaptcha**: A widely used captcha service by Google.

### Adding New Providers

To add a new captcha provider, you can implement the `CaptchaInterface`. Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to implement a new provider:

1. **Create a New Folder**: Create a new folder for your provider (e.g., `packages/myprovider`).
2. **Implement the Interface**: Create a class that implements the `CaptchaInterface`. This class should handle the logic for verifying captchas and rendering the captcha elements.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   import type { CaptchaInterface } from '@captchahub/core';

   export class MyProviderCaptcha implements CaptchaInterface {
       async verifyCaptcha(formFieldValues: Record<string, any>): Promise<boolean> {
           // Implement the logic to verify the captcha
       }

       getCaptchaScript(): React.FC {
           // Return the captcha script as a React component
       }

       getCaptchaFormElement(): React.FC {
           // Return the captcha form element as a React component
       }
   }
   ```

## Installation

Install the package using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @captchahub/core
```

## Usage

### Getting the Captcha Script

The `getCaptchaScript` function is used to retrieve the captcha script for rendering. It can be used as follows:

```typescript
import { getCaptchaScript } from '@captchahub/core';

const config = {
    CAPTCHA_PROVIDER: 'your-provider', // Specify the captcha provider
    // Additional provider-specific configuration can go here
};

const CaptchaComponent = async () => {
    const CaptchaScript = (await getCaptchaScript(config)) as React.FC;

    return (
        <div>
            <CaptchaScript />
            {/* Additional form elements */}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Getting the Captcha Form Element

The `getCaptchaFormElement` function is used to retrieve the captcha form element for rendering. It can be used as follows:

```typescript
import { getCaptchaFormElement } from '@captchahub/core';

const config = {
    CAPTCHA_PROVIDER: 'your-provider', // Specify the captcha provider
    // Additional provider-specific configuration can go here
};

const CaptchaFormComponent = async () => {
    const CaptchaFormElement = (await getCaptchaFormElement(config)) as React.FC;

    return (
        <div>
            <CaptchaFormElement />
            {/* Additional form elements */}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Verifying the Captcha

The `verifyCaptcha` function is used to verify the captcha response. It can be used as follows:

```typescript
import { verifyCaptcha } from '@captchahub/core';

const config = {
    CAPTCHA_PROVIDER: 'your-provider', // Specify the captcha provider
    // Additional provider-specific configuration can go here
};

const formFieldValues = {
    // Your form field values that need to be verified
};

const isValid = await verifyCaptcha(formFieldValues, config);
if (isValid) {
    console.log('Captcha verified successfully!');
} else {
    console.error('Captcha verification failed.');
}
```

### Configuration

Configuration for the captcha provider can be defined in a configuration object passed to the factory when creating the captcha instance. The configuration object must include the `CAPTCHA_PROVIDER` property to specify which captcha provider to use. Additional properties may be required depending on the specific provider.

## Extensibility

The CaptchaHub is designed to be extensible. You can create new captcha providers by implementing the `CaptchaInterface`. This allows you to add support for additional captcha services in the future.

## Rationale

The CaptchaHub is designed to provide a consistent and extensible foundation for managing captcha workflows in TypeScript applications. By using well-defined interfaces and tools, developers can easily integrate captcha capabilities into their web applications.
